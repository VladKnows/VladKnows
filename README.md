# Hi there, I'm Vlad Stoean! 👋

**Design Verification Engineer @ AMD | Master Student in AI**

I am a software engineer passionate about **solving complex technical challenges** and optimizing workflows.

For me, engineering is about more than just writing code. It's about understanding complex systems, automating repetitive tasks, and designing efficient solutions. Whether I'm debugging low-level hardware interactions or building backend logic, I am driven by a curiosity to understand how things truly work.

I thrive on continuous learning and competition. I treat every project as a chance to explore new paradigms—from the rigorous constraints of embedded systems to the flexibility of modern software architecture.
