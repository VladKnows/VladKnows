# Welcome to My GitHub! 🎉

Hey there! I'm Vlad Stoean, a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Gheorghe Asachi Technical University. I'm passionate about coding, creating, and constantly learning new things.

## About Me

I have fun working on small and big projects alike. I also work with friends on collaborative projects and go to programming contests. I'm proficient in C/C++, C#, Java, and Python. My latest passion is embedded software.

## Projects and Competitions

### NXP Cup 2024 🏎️
One of my proudest moments was participating in the NXP Cup, where I advanced to the international phase in Germany. This contest involved designing, programming, and racing 1/16 scale autonomous cars. It was an incredible experience working with embedded C and C++ to create algorithms for the car's navigation and obstacle detection. 🏁

### Miririri 🕹️
Miririri is a Java RPG game I created about a boy who helps villagers fight monsters in a remote town. It was a fun project that allowed me to explore game development. This was not only my first interaction with design patterns but also my first opportunity to play around with OOP. 🎮

### Other Projects
- **ConsoleRunner**: A simple yet interesting game made for the Visual Studio terminal in which you play as a drone trying to avoid being hit. 🎲
- **YouTube Transcript Translator**: A Python app using Kivy Framework and Translators API to translate YouTube video transcripts. 🎥

## Volunteering and Courses
I'm also involved in BEST Iaşi, where I handled the Logistics & IT part of the "Prove it" competition.
